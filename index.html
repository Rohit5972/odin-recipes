        <p>Gajar ka halwa is a combination of nuts, milk, sugar, khoya and ghee with grated carrots. It is a light nutritious dessert with less fat (a minimum of 10.03% and an average of 12.19%) than many other typical sweets from the Indian subcontinent. Gajar ka halwa has a medium shelf life so it is now sometimes exported
            Gajar ka Halwa, a quintessential Indian dessert, is a rich and aromatic sweet treat made from finely grated carrots, simmered in milk, and flavored with cardamom and ghee. Its warm, caramelized sweetness and creamy texture make it a beloved comfort food during festive seasons and special occasions. The process of making gajar ka halwa involves slowly cooking grated carrots in full-fat milk until it thickens and reduces to a luscious pudding-like consistency. The addition of sugar, cardamom, and ghee enhances its depth of flavor, while fried nuts and raisins add a delightful crunch. Often garnished with extra nuts and occasionally a touch of saffron, gajar ka halwa offers a perfect blend of sweetness and warmth, capturing the essence of traditional Indian sweets in every bite.
